    <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats to support prostate health.</li>
    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Engage in regular physical activity to maintain overall health and reduce cancer risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Screening:</strong> Regular PSA testing, especially if you are at higher risk for prostate cancer due to age or family history.</li>
